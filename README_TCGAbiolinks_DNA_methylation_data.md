# Processing HARMONIZED DNA methylation data

## NOTE: Needs updates!!!

Pipeline for downloading HARMONIZED DNA methylation data from [TCGA](https://cancergenome.nih.gov) and [TARGET](https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target/research) projects using *[TCGAbiolinks](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/TCGAbiolinks/inst/doc/tcgaBiolinks.html)* R package. The script outputs matrix with DNA methylation data for user-defined tissue types along with associated clinical information.

The TCGA genomic data harmonization is [here](https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/data-harmonization-and-generation/genomic-data-harmonization-0#Overview) and the the DNA methylation liftover pipeline is described [here](https://gdc-docs.nci.nih.gov/Data/Bioinformatics_Pipelines/Methylation_LO_Pipeline).

### Note
Make sure that R version >= 3.3 is installed. For older versions the *TCGAbiolinks* uses different functions starting with "TCGA" rather than "GDC" since the data were moved from DCC server to NCI Genomic Data Commons (GDC).
Make sure that the [newest *TCGAbiolinks* package](https://github.com/BioinformaticsFMRP/TCGAbiolinks) is installed.

```
devtools::install_github(repo = "BioinformaticsFMRP/TCGAbiolinks")
```
