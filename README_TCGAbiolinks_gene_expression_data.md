# Processing legacy gene expression data

Pipeline for downloading LEGACY gene expression data from [TCGA](https://cancergenome.nih.gov) and [TARGET](https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target/research) projects using *[TCGAbiolinks](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/TCGAbiolinks/inst/doc/tcgaBiolinks.html)* R package. The script outputs normalised expression or raw count matrix for RNA-seq data for user-defined tissue types along with associated clinical information.

<br />

3. **Tissue code**. Tissue types to be considered for download. Each tissue type is expected to be separated by comma. Type '*all*' for all listed tissue types to be considered for download. Available options are:

      Tissue code | Letter code | Definition
      ------------ | ------------ | ------------
      1 | TP  | Primary solid Tumour
      2 | TR  | Recurrent Solid Tumour
      3 | TB  | Primary Blood Derived Cancer - Peripheral Blood
      4 | TRBM | Recurrent Blood Derived Cancer - Bone Marrow
      5 | TAP | Additional - New Primary
      6 | TM | Metastatic
      7 | TAM | Additional Metastatic
      8 | THOC | Human Tumour Original Cells
      9 | TBM | Primary Blood Derived Cancer - Bone Marrow
      10 | NB | Blood Derived Normal
      11 | NT | Solid Tissue Normal
      12 | NBC | Buccal Cell Normal
      13 | NEBV | EBV Immortalised Normal
      14 | NBM | Bone Marrow Normal
      20 | CELLC | Control Analyte
      40 | TRB | Recurrent Blood Derived Cancer - Peripheral Blood
      50 | CELL | Cell Lines
      60 | XP | Primary Xenograft Tissue
      61 | XCL | Cell Line Derived Xenograft Tissue
      All | --- | All available tissue types
<br />

4. **Normalised data**. If "*norm*" is specified, the upper quartile normalised RSEM count estimates ("[*normalized_count*](https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/tcga/rnaseq+version+2)") are provided. Otherwise, read count data reflecting the number of reads mapping to each gene are provided (**default**).

### Note
Make sure that R version >= 3.3 is installed. For older versions the *TCGAbiolinks* uses different functions starting with "TCGA" rather than "GDC" since the data were moved from DCC server to NCI Genomic Data Commons (GDC).
Make sure that the [newest *TCGAbiolinks* package](https://github.com/BioinformaticsFMRP/TCGAbiolinks) package is installed.

```
devtools::install_github(repo = "BioinformaticsFMRP/TCGAbiolinks")
```
